# GraphQL API Security

### Project for SJSU's CMPE 279 (Software Security) course

This project features a GraphQL API implementation. The GraphQL schema, resolvers, and mock data were built with JavaScript and the Apollo Server framework, designed for a system where users can explore/add/update recipes, read recipe reviews, and view other users' profiles. Using this as a foundation, we have implemented and demonstrated various GraphQL API security best practices, including:

* Authentication
* Object Level Authorization
* Object Field Level Authorization
* Disabled Introspection
* Input Validation
* Query Depth Limitation
* Rate Limiting
